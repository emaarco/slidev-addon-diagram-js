 * Entry points (where the reachable-code graph starts):
 *   - setup/main.ts     Slidev auto-loads this to register the addon's components.
 *   - components/**\/*.vue  The published component surface consumers import directly;
 *                          marked as entry so its public exports aren't flagged unused.
 * vite/vitest config files are auto-detected by knip's built-in plugins (which also
 * treat tests/**\/*.test.ts as entry), so they don't need listing here.
